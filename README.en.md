# Frontend Test Task (Veronika Lanchuv)

This project was created with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Preparing

1. Make sure you have an LTS version of Node.js installed on your computer.
   [Download and install](https://nodejs.org/en/) if needed.
2. Install the project's base dependencies with the `npm install` command.
3. Start development mode by running the `npm start` command.

## Deploy

The production version of the project will automatically be linted, built, and
deployed to GitHub Pages, in the `gh-pages` branch, every time the `main` branch
is updated. For example, after a direct push or an accepted pull request.
